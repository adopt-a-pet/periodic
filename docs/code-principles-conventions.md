### Conventions keep everything consistent. Having common patterns and coding conventions reduces the developer's decision fatigue which frees up our brain space to tackle the hard problems.

## Required reading

We are keeping our conventions as mainstream as possible. We are basing our ESLint configuration off of AirBnB's and our Vue component guidelines off the official [Vue style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide). Please read Vue docs first, as the content here in this document is only _in addition to_ these guidelines (or they are reiterated here to emphasize the importance).
